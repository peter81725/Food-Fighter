# Food-Fighter
以Python語言撰寫，利用Scikit-Learn 和 TensorFlow 進行機器學習、深度學習。最後以Docker部屬程式，運用Fast API串接Line Bot呈現結果。

1. 食譜推薦: 在食譜的分群上使用K-Means，並依用戶的問卷資訊，將用戶歸納在特定食譜群。一開始，我們以最熱門食譜的推薦，解決冷啟動問題。推薦模型部分，則應用基於模型的協同過濾，建立推薦矩陣。
2. 食物小百科 (影像處理): 使用TensorFlow進行深度學習，選擇Yolo(v4)進行建模。為了解決Yolo誤判bounding-box類別的問題，我們決定，使用者在Input照片時，Yolo模型會將擷取的bounding-box，串接到ResNet模型，再次進行類別辨識，以提升精準度。

Programming with Python, the model was trained by using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for ML and DL. The application was deployed on docker and connected to Line Bot via Fast API.

1. Recipe recommendation: Recipes are grouped by K-Means Clustering and user's information are generated by questionnaire, which will place an user into specific recipe group. In order to solve cold start issue, the top-three-popular items will be presented at the beginning. Our recommendation model was inspired by model-based collaborative filtering.
2. Food Encyclopedia (Image Processing): Yolo(v4) was selected as our model and it was trained on TensorFlow. In order to solve the mis-classification issue of the result bounding-box, while user input a photo,  Yolo model will extract the captured bounding-box to another ResNet model, and the latter will perform classification again.
